## üöÄ Overview

**DeSciOS** is a containerized, headless Linux desktop environment purpose-built for decentralized science. Accessible entirely through a browser, it combines lightweight desktop streaming with research productivity tools and AI-readiness.

***Key goal**: Decentralize open source scientific software that remains trapped in centralized silos.*

Originally inspired by the idea of a Stadia-like environment, **DeSciOS** evolves that vision toward enabling:

- Local-first scientific computing
- AI-assistance (with Ollama and DeepSeek-R1:8B model)
- Peer-to-peer workflows (IPFS support included)
- Modular scientific desktop environments for students, researchers, and citizen scientists

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Experimental Project ‚Äî Expect Rough Edges**

DeSciOS is currently under active development and remains **experimental**. It provides a proof-of-concept platform for future decentralized science infrastructure. While usable today, it is **not yet production-ready**.

You **might encounter**:
- Unpolished workflows
- GPU acceleration limitations (browser-dependent)
- Manual setup requirements

That said, it's ready for contributors, educators, and DeSci enthusiasts eager to shape open research infrastructure.
